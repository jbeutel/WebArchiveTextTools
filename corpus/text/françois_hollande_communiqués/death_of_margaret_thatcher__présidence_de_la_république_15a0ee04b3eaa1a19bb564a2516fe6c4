Publié le 08 Avril 2013Rubrique : International, développement et francophonieMargaret Thatcher’s death marks the disappearance of a great figure who made a deep impression on her country’s history during her 11 years as British Prime Minister.Throughout her public life, holding true to her firm conservative beliefs, she cared about the United Kingdom’s influence and the defence of her country’s interests.The relationship she maintained with France was always frank and loyal.  She forged a constructive, fruitful dialogue with François Mitterrand.  Together, they committed themselves to strengthening ties between our two countries.  And it was at this time when Mrs Thatcher gave decisive impetus to the construction of the Channel Tunnel.President Hollande extends his deepest and very sincere condolences to Margaret Thatcher’s family and close friends and expresses his solidarity with the British people.
